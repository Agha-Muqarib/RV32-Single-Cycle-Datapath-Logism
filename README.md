## Instructions

To simulate, follow these steps:

### Custom Instructions:

* Open [Venus](https://www.kvakil.me/venus/).
* Write your customised instructions and click on dump to get the hex code.
* Create a .txt file (say "x.txt")
* Copy the hex code from venus into "x.txt" and save it.
* Clone this repository and open  [Combined.circ]( https://github.com/Agha-Muqarib/RV32-Single-Cycle-Datapath-Logism/blob/main/Combined.circ).
